## Why Listen API?

- **High quality podcast database**: Our data is aggregated from multiple sources and updated 24/7. Podcast data are inherently messy (e.g., malformed RSS feed, broken audio links...). We built a lot of sophisticated internal tools to clean up such messy data automatically and manually 24/7. Read [DOCS](https://www.listennotes.com/api/docs/) for all endpoints and sample JSON responses.
- **Fast, reliable, scalable**: We take care of the complex backend infrastructure, so you can focus on your product. See [STATUS](https://www.listennotesstatus.com/) for system health.
- **Save time. Save money.**: It costs more than $100 for 1 hour engineering time in San Francisco. Using Listen API can easily save you hundreds of hours engineering time to build a very basic version of your own podcast database and thousands more hours to improve / maintain the infrastructure down the road.
- **The Best Customer Support**: If you subscribe to the PRO or ENTERPRISE plan, you will get fast and informative replies from the founder and CEO of Listen Notes, who built this whole thing by hand and by heart.
- **The Best Customer Support**: Trusted by 5,400+ companies and developers. Listen API is used by full-fledged podcast player apps, music apps, audiobook apps, smart speaker apps, PR agencies, marketing platforms, content curation services, EdTech products, and more.
- **Here today and tomorrow**: We've been around since 2017 and we plan on being around for a long time. Listen API is a critical part of our core business. We care a lot. We actively improve Listen API. This is unlike other hobby projects from big companies, which can easily disappear after a reorg.
